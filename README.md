# RPG-Game
I have recently been working on learning [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) using [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) tutorials on YouTube. 
It has always been a dream of mine to make a functioning Role-Playing Game that I think myself and my peers would enjoy. I'm using GitHub to act as a functioning version control, and a dynamic task list. I will likely be updating the task list constantly as I continue to think of concepts that I think will fit into my idea. Later, I will add a full description of what I think the game will turn into and how it should function. It will be completely written using the OpenGL concept and the C++ language and properties.

## Task List
- [ ] Plan out some basic functionality and plot
- [ ] Some hand-drawn concept textures
- [ ] Get a functioning GLFW window initialized with some shaders attached

## Game Function
  An RPG with NPCs and dialogue. Some NPCs will have quests to send the player on that will make him clear dungeons by slaying monsters and solving puzzles. There will be skills based off of the player's class that they will be able to improve to make them more proficient in that skill. At the end of each dungeon will be a boss that the player will have to beat to clear the dungeon.
  
## Notes To Self
